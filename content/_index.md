## Hi there!

### I'm David Daza.

I work as fullstack developer at [Random Monkey](http://randommonkey.io/en) and [Datasketch](https://www.datasketch.co/en). Recently, I became the &#8220;community leader&#8221; of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) in Bogot√°, Colombia.

If you're interested in the content I used for the first meetup, you can check it out on my [GitHub](https://github.com/ddazal/vue-js-basics).

If you're interested of being part of the community you can reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_daviddaza) or via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ddazal).

I'm thinking of starting a blog where I could write about everything I learn and may be useful for other people. Stay connected!
